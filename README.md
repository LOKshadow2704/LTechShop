## MVC Architecture

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes data objects and functions to access and manipulate data.
- **View:** Represents the user interface of the application. It displays data from the model to users and generates forms to submit data.
- **Controller:** Handles requests from users. It is responsible for processing data sent from the interface, interacting with the model, and passing data to the interface.
